Note: May want to put create_main_screen/create_schedule_screen in separate functions to allow a larger
"main" function to do logic.
- Depends on if the widgets need to be self variables or do not need to be referenced again.

Think about making time, logo, ref map button, constant in the main() function. Would remove
code from the classes for the screens.

Use treeview to display info about trains.
